## Brand

Health and Wellbeing is a broad topic that covers a variety of different elements, we chose to go with a Puzzle theme, since each exercise, activity or goal is a small piece to becoming better and improving. Stylistically this is reflected in the use of puzzle piece elements throughout the design.
