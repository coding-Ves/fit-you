## Brand :paintbrush:

<img width='100%' src='https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/fit-you-49487.appspot.com/o/images%2FReadMe%2FBrand%20ideas.jpg?alt=media&token=97b1e74a-9714-45ed-afa4-5104b33307d4'>

Health and Wellbeing is a broad topic that covers a variety of different elements, we chose to go with a Puzzle theme, since each exercise, activity or goal is a small piece to becoming better and improving. Stylistically this is reflected in the use of puzzle piece elements throughout the design.

The brand accents and images were custom made, using Photoshop, thanks to CSS & background-blend, all images change with the theme change.

#### Name

We chose the name of the app so it represents the mission we set out on when designing and building it, combining our aim for flexibility and better health.

**Fit:**

-   of a suitable quality, standard, or type to meet the required purpose.
-   in good health, especially because of regular physical exercise.

**You:**

This app is built for it's users and their unique needs.

### Brand colors

We've chosen blue as our main brand color as it often represents trust, calm, stability and depth in color theory. We've only overwriten the primary and secondary colors in the Material UI default theme.

**Light theme:**
Primary color: <span style="color:#3a6b94; font-weight: 800;" >#3a6b94</span>
Secondary color: <span style="color:#175075; font-weight: 800;" >#175075</span>

**Dark theme:**
Primary color: <span style="color:#6d95b9m; font-weight: 800;" >#6d95b9</span>
Secondary color: <span style="color:#398aa0; font-weight: 800;" >#398aa0</span>

## Planning & Project Management :memo:

### Before we started coding :bulb:

We spent the first days of our project planning out our brand, creating a wireframe for the basic look of our app and mapping out our Firebase db structure.

### Wireframe

Examples of the initial wireframe, changes were made as the project progressed.

<img width='100%' src='https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/fit-you-49487.appspot.com/o/images%2FReadMe%2FPlanning.jpg?alt=media&token=f48451e8-f602-467d-9edd-b86c196c3a30'>

<img width='100%' src='https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/fit-you-49487.appspot.com/o/images%2FReadMe%2FUser%20flow.jpg?alt=media&token=d274cfb0-5842-496f-a669-a34b1d21ef6e'>

-   [**Wireframe**](https://studiolucky13.invisionapp.com/freehand/Fitness-Tracker-ZhYg9kXXN?dsid_h=ffef2dd1bac6fdde2c01e654b07926a5a565e3778a5d242a6924f3fb6373c1bd&uid_h=ce413ba828740814c190066ba19d9356009a8c87a52a11b301971b52ea25bbd0) - Covers the basic structure, the views and components we need and a few basic user flows

-   **DB structure** was mapped directly in Firebase documents and discussed in calls.

-   **Calls and discussions** happened by loosely following a scrum format with daily catch ups and impromptu (when needed) calls and pair programming sessions

-   **Issue tags** were created in GitLab, covering the different types of work _(Component, View, Functionality, Firebase, EXTRA)_

### Managing workload

Each team member started work on a separate part of the project. We split workload loosely by field, as to avoid merge conflicts and focus our efforts.

### Staying up-to-date

To keep up to date with commits and updates, a discord bot was integrated, which provided a snipped on each commit. We followed a pre-agreed structure for commit messages.

#### Home Page

<img width='100%' src='https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/fit-you-49487.appspot.com/o/images%2FReadMe%2FHome%20Page.jpg?alt=media&token=90389fea-740c-475c-8983-d0f9e43e5b60'>

Our home page provides an overview of the Product Features, a brief explanation on how it works and an About You page. We've decided to make it available to logged in users, with a difference that instead of a "Register" prompt, they see a "Dashboard" button

#### Register & Login

<img width='100%' src='https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/fit-you-49487.appspot.com/o/images%2FReadMe%2FRegister.jpg?alt=media&token=087a98b7-1065-44f9-84aa-f90895a58043'>

We have a 2 step registration process, which we manage via 2 different views. This is done so we can have two separate and modular forms instead 1. We opted for this instead of the Material UI build-in component.

#### Dashboard

<img width='100%' src='https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/fit-you-49487.appspot.com/o/images%2FReadMe%2FDashboard.jpg?alt=media&token=ef8e32ed-d9aa-43a4-9c9d-84d8e344811f'>

The Dashboard is the main page once logged in, it gives users shortcuts to all other functionalities and an overview of their app use.

#### My Activity

##### Main activity page

<img width='100%' src='https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/fit-you-49487.appspot.com/o/images%2FReadMe%2FAdd%20Activity.jpg?alt=media&token=68e826e8-ab3e-48c9-a721-29149c117d5e'>

We have 4 types of activities that users can browse and choose to add. For easy access to returning users, all 4 are accessible via link on the left-hand side navigation menu.

##### Exercise activities

##### Yoga activities

#### Social

We've decided to go with a simple Social approach, allowing users to follow each other, this provides a grounds for expanding the project with a Friends & Friend request functionality.

#### Profile

<img width='100%' src='https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/fit-you-49487.appspot.com/o/images%2FReadMe%2FUser%20Profile.jpg?alt=media&token=ec23b594-ec08-4fe5-b215-62ac2bc942ce'>

We've decided to follow a similar approach for the user's own profile and the profiles of others. The difference is that if the logged in user is the same as the profile they are viewing they can change their avatar and edit their profile information.

#### Dark Theme

<img width='100%' src='https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/fit-you-49487.appspot.com/o/images%2FReadMe%2FDark%20Theme.jpg?alt=media&token=2321a839-9e2d-49a6-9cf1-746eca6d64f5'>

To ensure good readibility and contrast with our Dark theme, we've used the Material UI `<Paper variant='elevation' elevation={3} > ` and set the elevation of different elements by importance.
